# Classify-X-rays-With-Machine-Learning
This project is a part of [Codecademy's Build Deep Learning Nodels with Tensorflow skill path.](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/paths/build-deep-learning-models-with-tensorflow) In this project I will demostrate building a neural network model, apply classification and model optimisation techniques.

In this project a will take a role of a researcher in a hospital lab and having given the task to develop a learning model that supports doctors with diagnosing illnesses that affect patients’ lungs. At my disposal, I have a set of X-ray lung scans with examples of patients who had either pneumonia, Covid-19, or no illness. Using the Keras module, I will create a classification model that outputs a diagnosis based on a patient’s X-ray scan. This model can help doctors with the challenge of deciphering X-ray scans and open a dialogue between your research team and the medical staff to create learning models that are as effective and interpretable as possible.
